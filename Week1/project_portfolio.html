        <h2 style="font-size: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: center;">About Me</h2>

        <p>Hello! I'm Hrishikesh Ahire, a passionate and hardworking Computer Science and Engineering student currently
            in my third semester.</p>

        <p>I am pursuing my degree from ITM(sls)BARODA UNIVERSITY and have maintained a strong academic record so far,
            with a SPI of 9.65 in the first semester and 9.83 in the second semester. My current CPI is 9.74.</p>

        <p>During my first semester, I was introduced to foundational subjects like Basic Electrical and Electronics
            Engineering (BEEE), Applied Mathematics–I (AM-1), C Programming, WordPress, and MIT App Inventor. These
            subjects helped me build a strong base in both hardware and software concepts.</p>

        <p>In my second semester, I explored Python programming, Python Turtle graphics, HTML, CSS, Applied
            Mathematics–II (AM-2), and Basics of Database Engineering (BDE). These courses strengthened my programming
            and web development skills.</p>

        <p>Currently, in my third semester, I am diving into more advanced topics like Java, JavaScript, and Discrete
            Mathematics, along with several other core subjects that will further enhance my problem-solving and
            development abilities.</p>

        <p>I am always eager to learn, build real-world projects, and expand my knowledge in the field of computer
            science and software development.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 20px;">Skills</h2>

        <p>As a Computer Science and Engineering student, I’ve been constantly developing a broad range of technical
            skills that allow me to build, analyze, and improve software systems. My skillset is shaped by hands-on
            practice, academic projects, and a genuine interest in technology.</p>

        <p>My journey began with <strong>C Programming</strong> in the first semester, where I learned the basics of
            programming — including variables, control structures, loops, arrays, functions, and pointers. This helped
            me build a strong logical foundation and approach problems in a structured way.</p>

        <p>I also explored platforms like <strong>MIT App Inventor</strong> and <strong>WordPress</strong>, which
            introduced me to drag-and-drop development, UI design, and content management. These tools helped me
            understand user experience and web publishing early in my learning curve.</p>

        <p>In the second semester, I moved into <strong>Python</strong>, a versatile and beginner-friendly programming
            language. I enjoyed creating interactive programs and experimenting with modules like <strong>Python
                Turtle</strong>, which deepened my creativity in visual programming. Python improved my confidence in
            writing cleaner and more efficient code.</p>

        <p>Alongside Python, I also studied <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, which allowed me to build
            static web pages with structured content and responsive styling. Learning how to design with code was
            exciting and helped me develop an eye for detail and layout.</p>

        <p>I was also introduced to <strong>database engineering</strong> concepts through DBMS (Database management
            System). This gave me practical knowledge of data storage, relationships, and SQL queries — essential for
            backend development and data-driven applications.</p>

        <p>Now in my third semester, I’m expanding into more advanced technologies. I’ve started learning
            <strong>Java</strong>, focusing on object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, objects,
            inheritance, and abstraction. Java is strengthening my ability to design modular, reusable code.
        </p>

        <p>I’m also exploring <strong>JavaScript</strong>, which is essential for making websites dynamic and
            interactive. It complements my HTML and CSS skills and is helping me understand the full frontend
            development workflow.</p>

        <p>In parallel, I’m studying <strong>Discrete Mathematics</strong>, which enhances my analytical thinking and
            forms the mathematical foundation behind algorithms, logic gates, graphs, and more.</p>

        <p>Additionally, I’ve started using <strong>Git and GitHub</strong> for version control and collaboration. These
            tools allow me to manage code changes, track progress, and work with others efficiently on projects.</p>

        <p>My technical journey is still evolving, and I’m committed to continuously learning new technologies,
            improving my coding practices, and building impactful projects that solve real-world problems.</p>
